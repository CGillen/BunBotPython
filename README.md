# Bunbot - Simple Shoutcast Discord Bot!
Bunbot! was originally a JavaScript-based bot, but has been rewritten in Python!

Bunbot currently supports the following Codecs:
`MP3`, `OPUS`, `VORBIS`, `AAC`, and `AAC+`


It's designed to play Shoutcast and some Icecast streams. It supports the following commands:
- `/play`: Starts playing the stream.
- `/leave`: Leaves the voice channel.
- `/refresh`: Refresh the current playing stream.
- `/song`: Displays the current song playing.
- `/support`: Learn where you can get Support!
###### Maintainer Only Commands:
- `/debug`: Displays Limited Debugging information; can be used by normal members, but displays significantly less!
- `/maint`: used to toggle maint mode on and off, used for maintaining the bot!

<sub>Any command relating to the favorites system is in progress and highly unstable!</sub>

# Requirements
- `ffmpeg` - [Download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
