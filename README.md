# Bunbot - Simple Shoutcast Discord Bot!
Bunbot was originally a java based bot, but is based on Python now!

It's designed to play Shoutcast v2 and some Icecast streams. It supports the following commands:
- `!play`: Start playing the stream.
- `!leave`: Leave the voice channel.
- `!refresh`: Refresh the stream list.
- `!song`: Display the current song playing.
