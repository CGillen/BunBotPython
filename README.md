# Bunbot - Simple Shoutcast Discord Bot!
Bunbot was originally a javascript based bot, but has been rewritten in Python now!


It's designed to play Shoutcast and some Icecast streams. It supports the following commands:
- `/play`: Start playing the stream.
- `/leave`: Leave the voice channel.
- `/refresh`: Refresh the stream list.
- `/song`: Display the current song playing.


# don't want to self host?
No problem!
