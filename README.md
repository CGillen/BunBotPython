# Bunbot - Simple Shoutcast Discord Bot!
Bunbot! was originally a JavaScript-based bot, but has been rewritten in Python!

Bunbot currently supports the following Codecs:
`MP3`, `OPUS`, `VORBIS`, `AAC`, and `AAC+`


It's designed to play Shoutcast and some Icecast streams. It supports the following commands:
- `/play`: Start playing the stream.
- `/leave`: Leave the voice channel.
- `/refresh`: Refresh the stream list.
- `/song`: Display the current song playing.
- `/support`: Learn where you can get help with the bot or how to help.

# Requirements
- `ffmpeg` - [Download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

# Don't want to self-host?
